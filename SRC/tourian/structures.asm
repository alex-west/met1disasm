;Tourian Structure Data

;The first byte of the structure definition states how many macros are in the first row of the
;structure. The the number of bytes after the macro number byte is equal to the value of the macro
;number byte and those bytes define what each macro in the row are. For example, if the macro number
;byte is #$08, the next 8 bytes represent 8 macros. The macro description bytes are the macro numbers
;and are multiplied by 4 to find the index to the desired macro in MacroDefs.  Any further bytes in
;the structure definition represent the next rows.  #$FF marks the end of the structure definition.
