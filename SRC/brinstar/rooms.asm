;Brinstar Room Definitions

;The first byte of the room definitions is attribute table data and is used to set the base color of
;the room. The object data is grouped into 3 byte segments and represents a structure in the room.
;The first byte of the structure data has the format yyyyxxxx and contains the y, x location of the
;structure in the room(measured in tiles). The second byte is an index into the StrctPtrTbl and
;identifies which structure to use.  The third byte is an attribute table byte and determines the
;color of the structure.  Most of the time, this byte will have the same value as the attribute byte
;for the base color of the room. Having a room base color byte reduces the calculations required to
;find the proper color for each structure as the structure attribute byte is skipped if it is the same
;as the room attribute byte. #$FD marks the end of the room objects portion of the room definition.
;Using the byte #$FE can be used as an empty place holder in the room data.  For example, if you
;wanted to remove a structure from a room, simply replace the three bytes associated with the structure
;with #$FE. The next portion of the room definition describes the enemies and doors in the room. The
;number of data bytes and their functions vary depending on what type of item is being loaded.
